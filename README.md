# -rankwatch17_php_screenshot
I have used googleapi for taking screenshot of URL that displayed on browser and it is storing in Images folder with the extension .jpg and the name of image would be the URL name.
In the form you have to enter the website url without http:// because i have already used in in the code.
I have also uploaded the two images(.jpg) after performing the code.
